# Global Sustainable Energy Trends (2000–2020) - Data Visualization  (LOOKER STUDIO)

This repository contains my **Data Visualization Lab Project**, where I analyzed **global sustainable energy trends from 2000 to 2020**. Using interactive dashboards, I explored **renewable energy growth, carbon emissions, energy access, and economic impact** to provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry professionals.  

## 📊 Project Overview  

This project leverages **Looker Studio** to visualize key energy metrics across the globe. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy), includes information on:  
- **Renewable Energy Trends** 🌱  
- **Electricity Generation by Source (Fossil, Nuclear, Renewable)** ⚡  
- **Energy Access & Clean Fuels Availability** 📊  
- **Carbon Emissions Trends & Top Contributing Countries** 🌍🔥  
- **Energy Consumption vs. Economic Growth (GDP)** 📈  
- **Annual Financial Assistance for Energy Development** 💰  

## 🔍 Key Visualizations  

### 1️⃣ Global Renewable Energy Share  
- **Geo Heatmap**: Displays the share of **renewable energy (%)** in total energy consumption by country.  
- **Bar Chart**: Illustrates the **growth of renewable energy over time (2000–2020)**.  

### 2️⃣ Annual Electricity Generation by Source  
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Compares electricity generation from **fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables**.  

### 3️⃣ Energy Access & Clean Fuels  
- **Line Chart**: Tracks the **percentage of the population with access to electricity and clean fuels** over time.  

### 4️⃣ CO₂ Emissions Analysis  
- **Bar Chart**: Shows annual **CO₂ emissions trends**, highlighting peak years.  
- **Top 5 Emitting Countries Chart**: Identifies the **highest CO₂ contributors** worldwide.  

### 5️⃣ Energy Consumption vs. Economic Growth  
- **Bubble Chart**: Examines the **relationship between energy efficiency and consumption per capita**.  
- **Line Graph**: Tracks **GDP growth (2000–2020) and its correlation with energy use**.  

### 6️⃣ Financial Assistance for Energy Initiatives  
- **Tree Map**: Visualizes **global financial flows for sustainable energy development**.  

## 🚀 Interactive Dashboard  

To make data exploration easier, I developed a **Looker Studio Dashboard** where users can filter insights by year and country.
